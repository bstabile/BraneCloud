If you have Visual Studio options set for multicore, make sure
you build the solution TWICE. In other words, don't start trying
to track down the slew of errors that appear on a first build.
That's just good old concurrency trying to mess with your mind!

When I can find the time, I'll add models and docs that explain everything.
In the meantime, you should definitely visit Sean Luke's ECJ project at GMU.
There you will find the original Java source code, and lot's of documentation.
