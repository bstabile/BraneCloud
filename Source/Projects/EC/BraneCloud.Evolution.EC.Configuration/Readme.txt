There's a lot going on in here that won't make much sense at the moment.
Once some of the new bits have replaced some of the old bits, 
it will be much easier to understand. ;-)

Currently the most imporant things to look at are ParamterDatabase and ECActivator.
You are probably better off not even looking at ParameterModel until I can migrate
that into place and get rid of some of the mechanisms it will replace.

The configuration system works fine at present, so long as you don't try to do
anything convoluted.
